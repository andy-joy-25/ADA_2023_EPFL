Sheldon insists that he knows the show better than anyone, and keeps making various claims about the show, which neither of them know how to prove or disprove. The two of them have reached out to you ladies and gentlemen, as data scientists, to help them. You will be given the full script of the series, with information on the episode, the scene, the person saying each dialogue line, and the dialogue lines themselves.\n",
